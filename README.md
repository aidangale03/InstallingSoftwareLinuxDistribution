<h1>Installing Software in a Linux Distribution</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of using an Advanced Package Tool (APT) and sudo to install and uninstall applications in a Linux Bash shell
<br />


<h2>Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Google Docs</b>
- <b>Advanced Package Tool (APT)</b>
- <b>Linux Bash Shell</b>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
Overall, I think this lab allowed me to gain a better understanding of a basic concept in using the Advanced Package Tool. I can now install and uninstall applications using this tool which can significantly spped up processes that would normally take longer without the APT.
